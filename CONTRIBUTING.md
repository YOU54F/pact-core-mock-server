`git cz` to commit and commitizen will guide you.

### Building

To build the libraries in this project, you need a working Rust environment. Refer to the [Rust Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

The build tool used is `cargo`.

```shell
cd rust
cargo build
```

This will compile all the libraries and put the generated files in `rust/target/debug`.

### Releasing

The released libraries for each module are built by a GH action that attaches the libraries to the GH release for each
crate. To release a crate, run the `release.groovy` script in the crate directory. This will guide you through the
release process for the crate. Then create a GH release using the tag and changelog created by the script.

To be able to release a component, you need to:
1. Have an account on [crates.io](crates.io). Go to that site, and select "Log in with GitHub". It will auto-create your user account.
2. Get a maintainer to invite you to the crate for the component.
3. Accept the invite on crates.io. This will allow you to release the Rust crate to crates.io.
4.
